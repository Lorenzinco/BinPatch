## Patching

You need one of the following assembler installed and available in your PATH:

- [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/)
- [yasm](http://yasm.tortall.net/)
- [gas](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)
- [llvm-as](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-as.html)

This functionality is tested mainly with `nasm`. Please report any issues with other assemblers.

## Known issues

- Some key combinations may not work as expected, notably `SHIFT + ENTER` on VSCode terminal. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/issues/685) for more information. Unfortunately, this behavior is out of my control.

## Special thanks

Thanks to [Lorenzo Colombini](https://github.com/Lorenzinco) for the instruction highlighting.
